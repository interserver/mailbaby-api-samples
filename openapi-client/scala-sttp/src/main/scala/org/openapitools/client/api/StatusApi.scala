 * **Send emails fast and with confidence through our easy to use [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API interface.** # Overview This is the API interface to the [Mail Baby](https//mail.baby/) Mail services provided by [InterServer](https://www.interserver.net). To use this service you must have an account with us at [my.interserver.net](https://my.interserver.net). # Authentication In order to use most of the API calls you must pass credentials from the [my.interserver.net](https://my.interserver.net/) site. We support several different authentication methods but the preferred method is to use the **API Key** which you can get from the [Account Security](https://my.interserver.net/account_security) page.
