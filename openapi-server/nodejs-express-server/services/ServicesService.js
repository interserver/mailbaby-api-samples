* Get one mail order's full detail including SMTP password

Required: `id` (path; obtain from `GET /mail`). Returns the full detail record for one specific mail order identified by its numeric `id`.  The `username` and `password` values returned here can be used directly to authenticate against `relay.mailbaby.net:25` (SMTP AUTH) if you need to send email via a native SMTP client rather than through the REST API.  The `id` path parameter is the same integer `id` value returned by `GET /mail`.

* List your provisioned mail orders (sending accounts)
* Use this **before sending** if you need to discover which mail order `id` to pass to `/mail/send`, `/mail/advsend`, `/mail/rawsend`, `/mail/log`, or `/mail/stats`. Returns every mail order (active **and** canceled) on your account. Each record includes the numeric `id`, the `status` (`active` or `canceled`), the SMTP `username` (always `mb<id>`), and an optional `comment`.  The `id` values returned here are used as the `id` input parameter on all sending endpoints (`/mail/send`, `/mail/advsend`, `/mail/rawsend`) as well as the log and stats queries.  When the `id` parameter is omitted on those calls the API automatically picks the **first active** order returned by this endpoint.  To retrieve full details — including the current SMTP password — for a single order use `GET /mail/{id}`.
