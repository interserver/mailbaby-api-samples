Method | HTTP request | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------

[**view_mail_log**](HistoryApi.md#view_mail_log) | **GET** /mail/log | Displays the mail log


# **get_stats**
> MailStatsType get_stats(time=time)

Account usage statistics

Returns aggregate sending statistics for your mail account(s) across a selectable time window.  Useful for dashboards, billing reviews, and detecting unusual traffic patterns.

The response includes:
- **`usage`** — total messages accepted by the relay during the current billing
  cycle (used for cost calculation).
- **`cost`** — estimated cost for the billing cycle based on the base plan price
  plus per-email charges.
- **`received`** / **`sent`** — count of messages accepted by the relay /
  successfully delivered to the destination MX within the selected `time` window.
- **`volume`** — top-500 breakdown of message counts grouped by source IP (`ip`),
  destination address (`to`), and sender address (`from`) within the selected window.


**Time windows** (controlled by the `time` parameter):
| Value | Window | |-------|--------| | `1h` | Last 1 hour (default) | | `24h` | Last 24 hours | | `7d` | Last 7 days | | `month` | Current calendar month (1st to now) | | `day` | Today (midnight to now) | | `billing` | Current billing cycle (last invoice date to next invoice date) | | `all` | All time |


### Example

* Api Key Authentication (apiKeyAuth):

```python
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.models.mail_stats_type import MailStatsType
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.mailbaby.net
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.mailbaby.net"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure API key authorization: apiKeyAuth
configuration.api_key['apiKeyAuth'] = os.environ["API_KEY"]

# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['apiKeyAuth'] = 'Bearer'

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.HistoryApi(api_client)
    time = 1h # str | The time window to scope `received`, `sent`, and `volume` statistics. Does not affect `usage` or `cost`, which are always calculated over the current billing cycle.  Defaults to `1h`. (optional) (default to 1h)

    try:
        # Account usage statistics
        api_response = api_instance.get_stats(time=time)
        print("The response of HistoryApi->get_stats:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling HistoryApi->get_stats: %s\n" % e)
```



### Parameters

------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **time** | **str**| The time window to scope &#x60;received&#x60;, &#x60;sent&#x60;, and &#x60;volume&#x60; statistics. Does not affect &#x60;usage&#x60; or &#x60;cost&#x60;, which are always calculated over the current billing cycle.  Defaults to &#x60;1h&#x60;. | [optional] [default to 1h]

### Return type

### HTTP response details

| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
**200** | OK |  -  |
**401** | Authentication failed.  Ensure you are sending a valid &#x60;X-API-KEY&#x60; header. Obtain your API key from [my.interserver.net/account_security](https://my.interserver.net/account_security). |  -  |

# **view_mail_log**
> MailLog view_mail_log(id=id, origin=origin, mx=mx, var_from=var_from, to=to, subject=subject, mailid=mailid, message_id=message_id, replyto=replyto, headerfrom=headerfrom, delivered=delivered, skip=skip, limit=limit, start_date=start_date, end_date=end_date)

Displays the mail log

Returns a paginated list of every email message accepted by the relay for your mail account(s).  All filter parameters are optional and combinable.

**Pagination** is controlled by `skip` and `limit`.  The response includes a `total` count so clients can determine how many pages exist.

**Date filtering** uses Unix timestamps (`startDate` / `endDate`).  For example, to retrieve emails sent in January 2024: `startDate=1704067200&endDate=1706745599`.

**Delivery status** can be filtered with the `delivered` parameter: `delivered=1` returns only successfully delivered messages; `delivered=0` returns messages still in queue or that failed.

**Address filtering** distinguishes between the SMTP envelope address (`from`, `to`) and message headers (`headerfrom` for the `From:` header, `replyto` for `Reply-To:`). These may differ when a message is sent on behalf of another address.

The `mailid` parameter corresponds to the `id` field in the returned `MailLogEntry` objects, **not** the `_id` field.  It also matches the transaction ID returned in the `text` field of a successful send response from `/mail/send`, `/mail/advsend`, or `/mail/rawsend`.

The `messageId` parameter searches the `Message-ID` email header (case-insensitive substring match).

    id = 2604 # int | The numeric ID of the mail order to filter by.  When omitted, logs from the first active mail order are returned.  Obtain valid IDs from `GET /mail` or `GET /mail/{id}`. (optional)
    origin = '1.2.3.4' # str | Filter by the originating IP address from which the message was submitted to the relay.  Must be a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address. (optional)
    mx = 'mx.google.com' # str | Filter by the MX hostname the relay attempted delivery to.  For example `mx.google.com` would return messages destined for Gmail recipients. Maps to `mxHostname` in the `MailLogEntry` response. (optional)
    var_from = 'me@sender.com' # str | Filter by SMTP envelope `MAIL FROM` address (exact match).  This is the address the relay used for bounce handling and may differ from the `From:` message header.  For header-level filtering use `headerfrom`. (optional)

Useful when you know the message ID generated by your application but not the relay `mailid`. (optional)
    replyto = 'replies@sender.com' # str | Filter by the `Reply-To` message header address (exact match).  Only returns messages where this header was explicitly set. (optional)
    headerfrom = 'newsletter@sender.com' # str | Filter by the `From` message header address (exact match).  This is the human-visible sender address and may differ from the SMTP envelope `from` parameter when sending on behalf of another address. (optional)
    delivered = 1 # int | Filter by delivery status.  `1` returns only messages that were successfully delivered to the destination MX.  `0` returns messages that are still queued, deferred, or failed.  Omit to return all messages regardless of delivery status. (optional)
    skip = 0 # int | Number of records to skip for pagination.  Use in combination with `limit` to page through large result sets.  Defaults to `0` (no skip). (optional) (default to 0)
    limit = 100 # int | Maximum number of records to return per page.  Defaults to `100`. Maximum allowed value is `10000`.  The response also includes a `total` field with the full matched count so you can calculate the number of pages. (optional) (default to 100)
