# **AddRule**
> GenericResponse AddRule(ctx, user, type_, data, body)
Creates a new email deny rule

Adds a deny rule to block specific senders, domains, destinations, or sender prefixes from being relayed through your mail account.  The `type` field selects the matching strategy: - **`email`** — exact match against the SMTP envelope `MAIL FROM` address. - **`domain`** — matches any sender address at the specified domain. - **`destination`** — exact match against the SMTP envelope `RCPT TO` address. - **`startswith`** — matches any sender address whose local-part (the portion   before the `@`) starts with the given string.  Only alphanumeric characters   and `+`, `_`, `.`, `-` are permitted in the prefix.   If `username` is provided it must be the SMTP username of one of your active mail orders (e.g. `mb20682`).  If omitted the rule is associated with your first active order.  On success the response `text` field contains the newly created rule's `id`, which can later be passed to `DELETE /mail/rules/{ruleId}` to remove it.

# **DeleteRule**
> GenericResponse DeleteRule(ctx, ruleId)
Removes a deny mail rule

Permanently removes a single deny rule identified by its numeric `ruleId`.  The `ruleId` is the `id` field returned by `GET /mail/rules` or the `text` field from a successful `POST /mail/rules` response.  Only rules belonging to your own active mail account(s) can be deleted — the server will reject attempts to delete rules that belong to a different account. 

### Required Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **ctx** | **context.Context** | context for authentication, logging, cancellation, deadlines, tracing, etc.
  **ruleId** | **int32**| The numeric ID of the deny rule to delete.  Obtain this from the &#x60;id&#x60; field in &#x60;GET /mail/rules&#x60; or the &#x60;text&#x60; field of a &#x60;POST /mail/rules&#x60; response. |

# **DelistBlock**
> GenericResponse DelistBlock(ctx, body, email)
Removes an email address from the block lists

Delists an email address from all three block list stores: 1. The rspamd spam-filter database (`fromemail` / envelope sender records). 2. The MailChannels integration block table. 3. The MailBaby internal block table.  Use `GET /mail/blocks` to discover which addresses are currently blocked.  The `from` field in any returned block entry is a valid input for this call.  **Note:** Delisting an address removes it from the block tracking databases but does not prevent the spam filter from re-blocking it if future messages continue to trigger filter rules. 

### Required Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **ctx** | **context.Context** | context for authentication, logging, cancellation, deadlines, tracing, etc.
  **body** | [**EmailAddressParam**](EmailAddressParam.md)|  | 
  **email** | **string**|  |

# **GetMailBlocks**
> MailBlocks GetMailBlocks(ctx, )
Displays a list of blocked email addresses

Returns addresses and messages that have been flagged by the spam filtering system for your mail account(s).  Three categories are returned:  - **`local`** — messages flagged by the `LOCAL_BL_RCPT` rspamd rule.  These are   messages sent to recipients on your account's local block list. - **`mbtrap`** — messages flagged by the `MBTRAP` rspamd rule.  These are messages   that triggered MailBaby's internal trap / honeypot detection. - **`subject`** — senders whose recent messages contain spam-indicative subjects   (strings containing `@`, `smtp`, `socks4`, or `socks5`) with high repetition   (more than 4 identical subjects from the same sender in the last 3 days).   The `local` and `mbtrap` results cover the last 5 days.  The `subject` results cover the last 3 days.  A sender address returned in any of these lists can be delisted using `POST /mail/blocks/delete` with the `email` field set to that address. 

### Required Parameters

# **GetRules**
> []DenyRuleRecord GetRules(ctx, )
Displays a listing of deny email rules

Returns all deny rules you have configured for your active mail account(s). Deny rules are evaluated **before** a message is transmitted and cause it to be rejected immediately when it matches.  Four rule types are supported: | `type` | `data` format | Effect | |--------|---------------|--------| | `email` | `user@domain.com` | Rejects any message from this exact sender address | | `domain` | `domain.com` | Rejects any message from any address at this domain | | `destination` | `user@domain.com` | Rejects any message addressed to this recipient | | `startswith` | `prefix` | Rejects any message whose sender address begins with this string (alphanumeric, `+`, `_`, `.`, `-` only) |  Use `POST /mail/rules` to add new rules and `DELETE /mail/rules/{ruleId}` to remove them.  The `id` field in each returned record is the value needed for the delete call. 

### Required Parameters
This endpoint does not need any parameter.

### Return type

[**[]DenyRuleRecord**](DenyRuleRecord.md)
