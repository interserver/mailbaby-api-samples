## getStats

> MailStatsType getStats(opts)

Account usage statistics

Returns aggregate sending statistics for your mail account(s) across a selectable time window.  Useful for dashboards, billing reviews, and detecting unusual traffic patterns.  The response includes: - **&#x60;usage&#x60;** — total messages accepted by the relay during the current billing   cycle (used for cost calculation). - **&#x60;cost&#x60;** — estimated cost for the billing cycle based on the base plan price   plus per-email charges. - **&#x60;received&#x60;** / **&#x60;sent&#x60;** — count of messages accepted by the relay /   successfully delivered to the destination MX within the selected &#x60;time&#x60; window. - **&#x60;volume&#x60;** — top-500 breakdown of message counts grouped by source IP (&#x60;ip&#x60;),   destination address (&#x60;to&#x60;), and sender address (&#x60;from&#x60;) within the selected window.   **Time windows** (controlled by the &#x60;time&#x60; parameter): | Value | Window | |-------|--------| | &#x60;1h&#x60; | Last 1 hour (default) | | &#x60;24h&#x60; | Last 24 hours | | &#x60;7d&#x60; | Last 7 days | | &#x60;month&#x60; | Current calendar month (1st to now) | | &#x60;day&#x60; | Today (midnight to now) | | &#x60;billing&#x60; | Current billing cycle (last invoice date to next invoice date) | | &#x60;all&#x60; | All time | 

### Example

```javascript
import MailBabyEmailDeliveryAndManagementServiceApi from 'mail_baby_email_delivery_and_management_service_api';
let defaultClient = MailBabyEmailDeliveryAndManagementServiceApi.ApiClient.instance;
// Configure API key authorization: apiKeyAuth
let apiKeyAuth = defaultClient.authentications['apiKeyAuth'];
apiKeyAuth.apiKey = 'YOUR API KEY';
// Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
//apiKeyAuth.apiKeyPrefix = 'Token';

let apiInstance = new MailBabyEmailDeliveryAndManagementServiceApi.HistoryApi();
let opts = {
  'time': "'1h'" // String | The time window to scope `received`, `sent`, and `volume` statistics. Does not affect `usage` or `cost`, which are always calculated over the current billing cycle.  Defaults to `1h`.
};
apiInstance.getStats(opts, (error, data, response) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + data);
  }
});
```

## viewMailLog

> MailLog viewMailLog(opts)

Displays the mail log

Returns a paginated list of every email message accepted by the relay for your mail account(s).  All filter parameters are optional and combinable.  **Pagination** is controlled by &#x60;skip&#x60; and &#x60;limit&#x60;.  The response includes a &#x60;total&#x60; count so clients can determine how many pages exist.  **Date filtering** uses Unix timestamps (&#x60;startDate&#x60; / &#x60;endDate&#x60;).  For example, to retrieve emails sent in January 2024: &#x60;startDate&#x3D;1704067200&amp;endDate&#x3D;1706745599&#x60;.  **Delivery status** can be filtered with the &#x60;delivered&#x60; parameter: &#x60;delivered&#x3D;1&#x60; returns only successfully delivered messages; &#x60;delivered&#x3D;0&#x60; returns messages still in queue or that failed.  **Address filtering** distinguishes between the SMTP envelope address (&#x60;from&#x60;, &#x60;to&#x60;) and message headers (&#x60;headerfrom&#x60; for the &#x60;From:&#x60; header, &#x60;replyto&#x60; for &#x60;Reply-To:&#x60;). These may differ when a message is sent on behalf of another address.  The &#x60;mailid&#x60; parameter corresponds to the &#x60;id&#x60; field in the returned &#x60;MailLogEntry&#x60; objects, **not** the &#x60;_id&#x60; field.  It also matches the transaction ID returned in the &#x60;text&#x60; field of a successful send response from &#x60;/mail/send&#x60;, &#x60;/mail/advsend&#x60;, or &#x60;/mail/rawsend&#x60;.  The &#x60;messageId&#x60; parameter searches the &#x60;Message-ID&#x60; email header (case-insensitive substring match). 

### Example

```javascript
import MailBabyEmailDeliveryAndManagementServiceApi from 'mail_baby_email_delivery_and_management_service_api';
let defaultClient = MailBabyEmailDeliveryAndManagementServiceApi.ApiClient.instance;
// Configure API key authorization: apiKeyAuth
let apiKeyAuth = defaultClient.authentications['apiKeyAuth'];
apiKeyAuth.apiKey = 'YOUR API KEY';
// Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
//apiKeyAuth.apiKeyPrefix = 'Token';

let apiInstance = new MailBabyEmailDeliveryAndManagementServiceApi.HistoryApi();
let opts = {
  'id': 2604, // Number | The numeric ID of the mail order to filter by.  When omitted, logs from the first active mail order are returned.  Obtain valid IDs from `GET /mail` or `GET /mail/{id}`.
  'origin': "1.2.3.4", // String | Filter by the originating IP address from which the message was submitted to the relay.  Must be a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.
  'mx': "mx.google.com", // String | Filter by the MX hostname the relay attempted delivery to.  For example `mx.google.com` would return messages destined for Gmail recipients. Maps to `mxHostname` in the `MailLogEntry` response.
  'from': "me@sender.com", // String | Filter by SMTP envelope `MAIL FROM` address (exact match).  This is the address the relay used for bounce handling and may differ from the `From:` message header.  For header-level filtering use `headerfrom`.
  'to': "you@receiver.com", // String | Filter by SMTP envelope `RCPT TO` address (exact match).  This is the delivery address used by the relay and may differ from the `To:` header when BCC recipients are involved.
  'subject': "Your order has shipped", // String | Filter by email `Subject` header (exact match).  To search for a substring, include it in the full subject text.
  'mailid': "185997065c60008840", // String | Filter by the relay-assigned mail ID string (exact match).  This corresponds to the `id` field in `MailLogEntry` and to the `text` value returned by the sending endpoints on success.  Format is an 18–19 character hexadecimal string such as `185997065c60008840`.
  'messageId': "<abc123@yourdomain.com>", // String | Filter by the `Message-ID` email header using a substring (case-insensitive) match.  The `Message-ID` is assigned by the sending mail client and is visible in the `messageId` field of `MailLogEntry`.  Useful when you know the message ID generated by your application but not the relay `mailid`.
  'replyto': "replies@sender.com", // String | Filter by the `Reply-To` message header address (exact match).  Only returns messages where this header was explicitly set.
  'headerfrom': "newsletter@sender.com", // String | Filter by the `From` message header address (exact match).  This is the human-visible sender address and may differ from the SMTP envelope `from` parameter when sending on behalf of another address.
  'delivered': 1, // Number | Filter by delivery status.  `1` returns only messages that were successfully delivered to the destination MX.  `0` returns messages that are still queued, deferred, or failed.  Omit to return all messages regardless of delivery status.
  'skip': 0, // Number | Number of records to skip for pagination.  Use in combination with `limit` to page through large result sets.  Defaults to `0` (no skip).
  'limit': 100, // Number | Maximum number of records to return per page.  Defaults to `100`. Maximum allowed value is `10000`.  The response also includes a `total` field with the full matched count so you can calculate the number of pages.
  'startDate': 1641781008, // Number | Earliest date to include, as a Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch). Messages with a `time` value **greater than or equal to** this value will be included.
  'endDate': 1673317008 // Number | Latest date to include, as a Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch). Messages with a `time` value **less than or equal to** this value will be included.
};
apiInstance.viewMailLog(opts, (error, data, response) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + data);
  }
