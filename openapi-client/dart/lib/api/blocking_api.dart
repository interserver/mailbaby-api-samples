  /// Creates a new email deny rule

  /// Adds a deny rule to block specific senders, domains, destinations, or sender prefixes from being relayed through your mail account.  The `type` field selects the matching strategy: - **`email`** — exact match against the SMTP envelope `MAIL FROM` address. - **`domain`** — matches any sender address at the specified domain. - **`destination`** — exact match against the SMTP envelope `RCPT TO` address. - **`startswith`** — matches any sender address whose local-part (the portion   before the `@`) starts with the given string.  Only alphanumeric characters   and `+`, `_`, `.`, `-` are permitted in the prefix.   If `username` is provided it must be the SMTP username of one of your active mail orders (e.g. `mb20682`).  If omitted the rule is associated with your first active order.  On success the response `text` field contains the newly created rule's `id`, which can later be passed to `DELETE /mail/rules/{ruleId}` to remove it.
