# **addRule**
> models::GenericResponse addRule(ctx, param_type, data, optional)
Create a deny rule to block a sender, domain, destination, or prefix

**Use this to prevent future relay attempts that match a pattern.** Required: `type` (`email`, `domain`, `destination`, or `startswith`) and `data` (the value to match). Optional: `user` (SMTP username; auto-selects first active order if omitted). Adds a deny rule to block specific senders, domains, destinations, or sender prefixes from being relayed through your mail account.  The `type` field selects the matching strategy: - **`email`** — exact match against the SMTP envelope `MAIL FROM` address. - **`domain`** — matches any sender address at the specified domain. - **`destination`** — exact match against the SMTP envelope `RCPT TO` address. - **`startswith`** — matches any sender address whose local-part (the portion   before the `@`) starts with the given string.  Only alphanumeric characters   and `+`, `_`, `.`, `-` are permitted in the prefix.   If `username` is provided it must be the SMTP username of one of your active mail orders (e.g. `mb20682`).  If omitted the rule is associated with your first active order.  On success the response `text` field contains the newly created rule's `id`, which can later be passed to `DELETE /mail/rules/{ruleId}` to remove it. 

### Required Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **ctx** | **context.Context** | context containing the authentication | nil if no authentication
  **param_type** | [**DenyRuleNew_type**](DenyRuleNew_type.md)|  | 
  **data** | **String**| The value to match against, interpreted according to `type`: a full email address for `email`/`destination`, a domain name for `domain`, or an alphanumeric prefix string for `startswith`. | 
 **optional** | **map[string]interface{}** | optional parameters | nil if no parameters

### Optional Parameters
Optional parameters are passed through a map[string]interface{}.

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **param_type** | [**DenyRuleNew_type**](DenyRuleNew_type.md)|  | 
 **data** | **String**| The value to match against, interpreted according to `type`: a full email address for `email`/`destination`, a domain name for `domain`, or an alphanumeric prefix string for `startswith`. | 
 **user** | **String**| Optional SMTP username of the mail order to associate this rule with (e.g. `mb20682`).  If omitted the first active order is used.  Valid usernames are the `username` values returned by `GET /mail`. |

# **delistBlock**
> models::GenericResponse delistBlock(ctx, email_address_param)
Delist an email address from the spam-filter block lists

**Destructive — wipes block records for the given address.** Required: `email` (must be a valid address; typically a `from` value previously returned by `GET /mail/blocks` or `GET /mail/log`). Delists an email address from all three block list stores: 1. The rspamd spam-filter database (`fromemail` / envelope sender records). 2. The MailChannels integration block table. 3. The MailBaby internal block table.  Use `GET /mail/blocks` to discover which addresses are currently blocked.  The `from` field in any returned block entry is a valid input for this call.  **Note:** Delisting an address removes it from the block tracking databases but does not prevent the spam filter from re-blocking it if future messages continue to trigger filter rules. 

### Required Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **ctx** | **context.Context** | context containing the authentication | nil if no authentication
  **email_address_param** | [**EmailAddressParam**](EmailAddressParam.md)|  |

# **getMailBlocks**
> models::MailBlocks getMailBlocks(ctx, )
List addresses currently flagged by spam-filter block lists

**Use this to discover which addresses to delist.** The `from` value of any returned entry can be passed to `POST /mail/blocks/delete` (as the `email` field) to remove the block. Returns addresses and messages that have been flagged by the spam filtering system for your mail account(s). Three categories are returned:  - **`local`** — messages flagged by the `LOCAL_BL_RCPT` rspamd rule.  These are   messages sent to recipients on your account's local block list. - **`mbtrap`** — messages flagged by the `MBTRAP` rspamd rule.  These are messages   that triggered MailBaby's internal trap / honeypot detection. - **`subject`** — senders whose recent messages contain spam-indicative subjects   (strings containing `@`, `smtp`, `socks4`, or `socks5`) with high repetition   (more than 4 identical subjects from the same sender in the last 3 days).   The `local` and `mbtrap` results cover the last 5 days.  The `subject` results cover the last 3 days.  A sender address returned in any of these lists can be delisted using `POST /mail/blocks/delete` with the `email` field set to that address. 

### Required Parameters

# **getRules**
> Vec<models::DenyRuleRecord> getRules(ctx, )
List custom deny rules (sender / domain / destination / prefix)

**Use this to inspect or pick a `ruleId` to delete.** Returns all deny rules you have configured for your active mail account(s). Deny rules are evaluated **before** a message is transmitted and cause it to be rejected immediately when it matches.  Four rule types are supported: | `type` | `data` format | Effect | |--------|---------------|--------| | `email` | `user@domain.com` | Rejects any message from this exact sender address | | `domain` | `domain.com` | Rejects any message from any address at this domain | | `destination` | `user@domain.com` | Rejects any message addressed to this recipient | | `startswith` | `prefix` | Rejects any message whose sender address begins with this string (alphanumeric, `+`, `_`, `.`, `-` only) |  Use `POST /mail/rules` to add new rules and `DELETE /mail/rules/{ruleId}` to remove them.  The `id` field in each returned record is the value needed for the delete call. 

### Required Parameters
This endpoint does not need any parameter.

### Return type

[**Vec<models::DenyRuleRecord>**](DenyRuleRecord.md)

# **deleteRule**
> models::GenericResponse deleteRule(ctx, rule_id)
Delete a deny rule by its numeric ruleId

**Destructive — permanently removes the rule.** Required: `ruleId` (path param; obtain from the `id` field returned by `GET /mail/rules` or the `text` field returned by `POST /mail/rules`). Permanently removes a single deny rule identified by its numeric `ruleId`.  The `ruleId` is the `id` field returned by `GET /mail/rules` or the `text` field from a successful `POST /mail/rules` response.  Only rules belonging to your own active mail account(s) can be deleted — the server will reject attempts to delete rules that belong to a different account. 

### Required Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **ctx** | **context.Context** | context containing the authentication | nil if no authentication
  **rule_id** | **i32**| The numeric ID of the deny rule to delete.  Obtain this from the `id` field in `GET /mail/rules` or the `text` field of a `POST /mail/rules` response. |
