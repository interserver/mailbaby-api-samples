/*! \brief Creates a new email deny rule. *Synchronous*

 * Adds a deny rule to block specific senders, domains, destinations, or sender prefixes from being relayed through your mail account.  The `type` field selects the matching strategy: - **`email`** — exact match against the SMTP envelope `MAIL FROM` address. - **`domain`** — matches any sender address at the specified domain. - **`destination`** — exact match against the SMTP envelope `RCPT TO` address. - **`startswith`** — matches any sender address whose local-part (the portion   before the `@`) starts with the given string.  Only alphanumeric characters   and `+`, `_`, `.`, `-` are permitted in the prefix.   If `username` is provided it must be the SMTP username of one of your active mail orders (e.g. `mb20682`).  If omitted the rule is associated with your first active order.  On success the response `text` field contains the newly created rule's `id`, which can later be passed to `DELETE /mail/rules/{ruleId}` to remove it. 
 * \param type The type of deny rule. *Required*
 * \param data The value to match against, interpreted according to `type`: a full email address for `email`/`destination`, a domain name for `domain`, or an alphanumeric prefix string for `startswith`. *Required*
 * \param user Optional SMTP username of the mail order to associate this rule with (e.g. `mb20682`).  If omitted the first active order is used.  Valid usernames are the `username` values returned by `GET /mail`.
