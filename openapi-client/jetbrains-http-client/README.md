# MailBaby Email Delivery and Management Service API - Jetbrains API Client

## General API description

**Send emails fast and with confidence through our easy to use [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API interface.** # Overview This is the API interface to the [Mail Baby](https//mail.baby/) Mail services provided by [InterServer](https://www.interserver.net). To use this service you must have an account with us at [my.interserver.net](https://my.interserver.net). # Authentication In order to use most of the API calls you must pass credentials from the [my.interserver.net](https://my.interserver.net/) site. We support several different authentication methods but the preferred method is to use the **API Key** which you can get from the [Account Security](https://my.interserver.net/account_security) page.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

You need [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) to be able to run those queries. More information can be found [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/http-client-in-product-code-editor.html).
You may have some luck running queries using the [Code REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) as well, but your mileage may vary.

### Variables and Environment files

* Generally speaking, you want queries to be specific using custom variables. All variables in the `.http` files have the `` format.
* You can create [public or private environment files](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/exploring-http-syntax.html#environment-variables) to dynamically replace the variables at runtime.

_Note: don't commit private environment files! They typically will contain sensitive information like API Keys._

### Customizations

If you have control over the generation of the files here, there are two main things you can do

* Select elements to replace as variables during generation. The process is case-sensitive. For example, API_KEY -> 
    * For this, run the generation with the `bodyVariables` property, followed by a "-" separated list of variables
    * Example: `--additional-properties bodyVariables=YOUR_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT-YOUR_COMPANY_ACCOUNT-YOUR_BALANCE_PLATFORM`
* Add custom headers to _all_ requests. This can be useful for example if your specifications are missing [security schemes](https://github.com/github/rest-api-description/issues/237).
    * For this, run the generation with the `customHeaders` property, followed by a "&" separated list of variables
    * Example : `--additional-properties=customHeaders="Cookie:X-API-KEY="&"Accept-Encoding=gzip"`
