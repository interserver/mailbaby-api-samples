# **GetStats**
> MailStatsType GetStats(ctx, optional)
Account usage statistics

Returns aggregate sending statistics for your mail account(s) across a selectable time window.  Useful for dashboards, billing reviews, and detecting unusual traffic patterns.  The response includes: - **`usage`** — total messages accepted by the relay during the current billing   cycle (used for cost calculation). - **`cost`** — estimated cost for the billing cycle based on the base plan price   plus per-email charges. - **`received`** / **`sent`** — count of messages accepted by the relay /   successfully delivered to the destination MX within the selected `time` window. - **`volume`** — top-500 breakdown of message counts grouped by source IP (`ip`),   destination address (`to`), and sender address (`from`) within the selected window.   **Time windows** (controlled by the `time` parameter): | Value | Window | |-------|--------| | `1h` | Last 1 hour (default) | | `24h` | Last 24 hours | | `7d` | Last 7 days | | `month` | Current calendar month (1st to now) | | `day` | Today (midnight to now) | | `billing` | Current billing cycle (last invoice date to next invoice date) | | `all` | All time | 

### Required Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **ctx** | **context.Context** | context for authentication, logging, cancellation, deadlines, tracing, etc.
 **optional** | ***HistoryApiGetStatsOpts** | optional parameters | nil if no parameters

### Optional Parameters
Optional parameters are passed through a pointer to a HistoryApiGetStatsOpts struct
Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **time** | **optional.String**| The time window to scope &#x60;received&#x60;, &#x60;sent&#x60;, and &#x60;volume&#x60; statistics. Does not affect &#x60;usage&#x60; or &#x60;cost&#x60;, which are always calculated over the current billing cycle.  Defaults to &#x60;1h&#x60;. | [default to 1h]

# **ViewMailLog**
> MailLog ViewMailLog(ctx, optional)
Displays the mail log

Returns a paginated list of every email message accepted by the relay for your mail account(s).  All filter parameters are optional and combinable.  **Pagination** is controlled by `skip` and `limit`.  The response includes a `total` count so clients can determine how many pages exist.  **Date filtering** uses Unix timestamps (`startDate` / `endDate`).  For example, to retrieve emails sent in January 2024: `startDate=1704067200&endDate=1706745599`.  **Delivery status** can be filtered with the `delivered` parameter: `delivered=1` returns only successfully delivered messages; `delivered=0` returns messages still in queue or that failed.  **Address filtering** distinguishes between the SMTP envelope address (`from`, `to`) and message headers (`headerfrom` for the `From:` header, `replyto` for `Reply-To:`). These may differ when a message is sent on behalf of another address.  The `mailid` parameter corresponds to the `id` field in the returned `MailLogEntry` objects, **not** the `_id` field.  It also matches the transaction ID returned in the `text` field of a successful send response from `/mail/send`, `/mail/advsend`, or `/mail/rawsend`.  The `messageId` parameter searches the `Message-ID` email header (case-insensitive substring match). 

### Required Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **ctx** | **context.Context** | context for authentication, logging, cancellation, deadlines, tracing, etc.
 **optional** | ***HistoryApiViewMailLogOpts** | optional parameters | nil if no parameters

### Optional Parameters
Optional parameters are passed through a pointer to a HistoryApiViewMailLogOpts struct
Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **id** | **optional.Int64**| The numeric ID of the mail order to filter by.  When omitted, logs from the first active mail order are returned.  Obtain valid IDs from &#x60;GET /mail&#x60; or &#x60;GET /mail/{id}&#x60;. | 
 **origin** | **optional.String**| Filter by the originating IP address from which the message was submitted to the relay.  Must be a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address. | 
 **mx** | **optional.String**| Filter by the MX hostname the relay attempted delivery to.  For example &#x60;mx.google.com&#x60; would return messages destined for Gmail recipients. Maps to &#x60;mxHostname&#x60; in the &#x60;MailLogEntry&#x60; response. | 
 **from** | **optional.String**| Filter by SMTP envelope &#x60;MAIL FROM&#x60; address (exact match).  This is the address the relay used for bounce handling and may differ from the &#x60;From:&#x60; message header.  For header-level filtering use &#x60;headerfrom&#x60;. | 
 **to** | **optional.String**| Filter by SMTP envelope &#x60;RCPT TO&#x60; address (exact match).  This is the delivery address used by the relay and may differ from the &#x60;To:&#x60; header when BCC recipients are involved. | 
 **subject** | **optional.String**| Filter by email &#x60;Subject&#x60; header (exact match).  To search for a substring, include it in the full subject text. | 
 **mailid** | **optional.String**| Filter by the relay-assigned mail ID string (exact match).  This corresponds to the &#x60;id&#x60; field in &#x60;MailLogEntry&#x60; and to the &#x60;text&#x60; value returned by the sending endpoints on success.  Format is an 18–19 character hexadecimal string such as &#x60;185997065c60008840&#x60;. | 
 **messageId** | **optional.String**| Filter by the &#x60;Message-ID&#x60; email header using a substring (case-insensitive) match.  The &#x60;Message-ID&#x60; is assigned by the sending mail client and is visible in the &#x60;messageId&#x60; field of &#x60;MailLogEntry&#x60;.  Useful when you know the message ID generated by your application but not the relay &#x60;mailid&#x60;. | 
 **replyto** | **optional.String**| Filter by the &#x60;Reply-To&#x60; message header address (exact match).  Only returns messages where this header was explicitly set. | 
 **headerfrom** | **optional.String**| Filter by the &#x60;From&#x60; message header address (exact match).  This is the human-visible sender address and may differ from the SMTP envelope &#x60;from&#x60; parameter when sending on behalf of another address. | 
 **delivered** | **optional.Int32**| Filter by delivery status.  &#x60;1&#x60; returns only messages that were successfully delivered to the destination MX.  &#x60;0&#x60; returns messages that are still queued, deferred, or failed.  Omit to return all messages regardless of delivery status. | 
 **skip** | **optional.Int32**| Number of records to skip for pagination.  Use in combination with &#x60;limit&#x60; to page through large result sets.  Defaults to &#x60;0&#x60; (no skip). | [default to 0]
 **limit** | **optional.Int32**| Maximum number of records to return per page.  Defaults to &#x60;100&#x60;. Maximum allowed value is &#x60;10000&#x60;.  The response also includes a &#x60;total&#x60; field with the full matched count so you can calculate the number of pages. | [default to 100]
 **startDate** | **optional.Int64**| Earliest date to include, as a Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch). Messages with a &#x60;time&#x60; value **greater than or equal to** this value will be included. | 
 **endDate** | **optional.Int64**| Latest date to include, as a Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch). Messages with a &#x60;time&#x60; value **less than or equal to** this value will be included. |
