--  MailBaby Email Delivery and Management Service API
--  **Send emails fast and with confidence through our easy to use [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API interface.**  # Overview  This is the API interface to the [Mail Baby](https://mail.baby/) Mail services provided by [InterServer](https://www.interserver.net). To use this service you must have an account with us at [my.interserver.net](https://my.interserver.net).  # Mail Orders  Every sending account in MailBaby is backed by a **Mail Order** — a provisioned sending credential with a numeric `id` and a corresponding SMTP username (`mb<id>`).  Most calls accept an optional `id` parameter; when omitted the API automatically selects the first active order on your account. Use `GET /mail` to list all orders, and `GET /mail/{id}` to inspect a single order including its current SMTP password.  # Sending Email  Three sending methods are available depending on your use_case: | Endpoint | Best for | |__________|__________| | `POST /mail/send` | Simple single_recipient messages | | `POST /mail/advsend` | Multiple recipients, CC/BCC, attachments, named contacts | | `POST /mail/rawsend` | Pre_built RFC 822 messages (e.g. DKIM_signed payloads) |  After a successful send each endpoint returns a `GenericResponse` whose `text` field contains the **transaction ID** assigned by the relay.  This ID can later be matched against entries in `GET /mail/log` via the `mailid` query parameter.  # Filtering & Logs  `GET /mail/log` provides paginated access to every message accepted by the relay for your account.  Combine any of the query parameters to narrow results — e.g. `from`, `to`, `subject`, `messageId`, `origin`, `mx`, `startDate`/`endDate`, and `delivered`.  # Blocking  Two independent mechanisms exist for suppressing unwanted email: _ **Block lists** (`GET /mail/blocks`, `POST /mail/blocks/delete`) — addresses flagged by the   system spam filters (LOCAL_BL_RCPT / MBTRAP rules in rspamd, and suspicious subjects). _ **Deny rules** (`GET /mail/rules`, `POST /mail/rules`, `DELETE /mail/rules/{ruleId}`) —   custom rules you configure to reject specific senders, domains, destination addresses, or   subject_line prefixes before a message is even attempted.   # Authentication  In order to use most of the API calls you must pass credentials from the [my.interserver.net](https://my.interserver.net/) site. We support several different authentication methods but the preferred method is to use the **API Key** which you can get from the [Account Security](https://my.interserver.net/account_security) page. Pass your key in the `X_API_KEY` HTTP request header for every protected call.
